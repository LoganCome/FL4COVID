# COVIDx Dataset
**Update 05/13/2020: Released new dataset with 258 COVID-19 train and 100 COVID-19 test samples. There are constantly new xray images being added to covid-chestxray-dataset, Figure1, Actualmed and COVID-19 radiography database so we included train_COVIDx3.txt and test_COVIDx3.txt, which are the xray images we used for training and testing of the CovidNet-CXR3 models.**

The current COVIDx dataset is constructed by the following open source chest radiography datasets:
* https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset
* https://github.com/agchung/Figure1-COVID-chestxray-dataset
* https://github.com/agchung/Actualmed-COVID-chestxray-dataset
* https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database
* https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge (which came from: https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC)

<!--We especially thank the Radiological Society of North America, National Institutes of Health, Figure1, Actualmed, M.E.H. Chowdhury et al., Dr. Joseph Paul Cohen and the team at MILA involved in the COVID-19 image data collection project for making data available to the global community.-->

## Steps to generate the dataset

1. Download the datasets listed above
 * `git clone https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset.git`
 * `git clone https://github.com/agchung/Figure1-COVID-chestxray-dataset.git`
 * `git clone https://github.com/agchung/Actualmed-COVID-chestxray-dataset.git`
 * go to this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) to download the COVID-19 Radiography database. Only the COVID-19 image folder and metadata file is required. The overlaps between covid-chestxray-dataset are handled
 * go to this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data) to download the RSNA pneumonia dataset
2. Create a `data` directory and within the data directory, create a `train` and `test` directory
3. Use [create\_COVIDx\_v3.ipynb](../create_COVIDx_v3.ipynb) to combine the three dataset to create COVIDx. Make sure to remember to change the file paths.
4. We provide the train and test txt files with patientId, image path and label (normal, pneumonia or COVID-19). The description for each file is explained below:
 * [train\_COVIDx2.txt](../train_COVIDx3.txt): This file contains the samples used for training COVIDNet-CXR.
 * [test\_COVIDx2.txt](../test_COVIDx3.txt): This file contains the samples used for testing COVIDNet-CXR.
